# Virtual Hospital Medic Calendar

This project is intended to be a prototype to implement a simple medical calendar used by some friends creating a developers group.

The idea is to create a simple project in just one sprint.

The REST API will be made using Django Rest Framework and it is in the [vhospital-drf](vhospital-drf) sub-directory.
